Apache-Mahout-cookbook
======================
This is the first revision of the Apache Mahout cookbook (http://bit.ly/KmwfX3).
Due to some bugs I decided to re-up on Github the whole code. 
The original code has 10 chapters and for every one of them there was a separate maevn project. 
In this realease I decide to have one whole Maven projetc where every chapter is separatated into a different package.
The code use Mahout 0.8 ad dependency and the dependency is mapped on a local jar. 
However you could change the dependency to the online one so to avoid having to compile the Mahout framework on you local environment. 
The code have been tested using NetBeans 7.4, into a single Linux MInt 16 Virtual Machine.
